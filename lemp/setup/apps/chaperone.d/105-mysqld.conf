# Start up the mysql server using the start_mysql.sh script.  Since this startup file comes after the initial
# 010-start.conf, these settings will be added to the mix.  Note that specifying the MySQL port works
# in most cases, but not all.  You'll see this in the apache2.conf configuration where PHP
# has to be told separately about the new socket.
#
# Starting MySQL this way has the advantage that the entire system, including MySQL, can run as the
# start-up user (the one specified with --user or --create on the chaperone command line).
